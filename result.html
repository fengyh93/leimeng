	<h3>Results:</h3>
<p>
	 All patients with a high pretest probability
of HIT (4Ts score = 6-7) had positive ELISA results,
compared to 26.1% of patients with intermediate (4Ts
score = 4-5) and 4.3% of patients with low (4Ts score â‰¤3)
pretest probability. No patients with 4Ts scores of 2 or less
had positive ELISA results.
</p>
<h3>Conclusions: </h3>
<p>
HIT can be ruled out in cancer patients
(negative predictive value and sensitivity = 100%) with
low pretest probability, defined by 4Ts scores of 2 or less,
significantly reducing the need for laboratory testing in
this patient population.
