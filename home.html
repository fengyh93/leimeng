	<h3>Objectives:</h3>
<p>
	To evaluate the use of a pretest probability
score (4Ts score) in cancer patients to guide ordering
of laboratory screening tests for heparin-induced
thrombocytopenia (HIT).
</p>
<h3>Methods: </h3>
<p>
A retrospective chart review was conducted for
patients (n = 140) in whom laboratory testing for HIT
was requested. 4Ts scores were calculated and correlated
with heparin-endogenous platelet factor 4 antibody
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test
results.
